description: "Don't tell your boss, but I want you to make a useless art project--because it's actually pretty useful. Why? Committing to uselessness is a freeing experiment. As professionals, we tend to focus on the end result instead of the process, and that's not healthy. Embrace the creative process (iteration and experimentation) on a project and see where the path takes you.\n\n\"Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work\" - Chuck Close"
