description: "The URL is universal in describing location within the web. Sadly linking within documents has been a start-stop process. The trusty Anchor tag is robust but very much a manual and time-intensive task. In publishing there is a huge level of complexity and over-head when you try to maintain unique anchor links when text is subject to change (developing stories, corrections, edits). As we see more single-page articles, especially long-form, this is a growing concern. Luckily there are number of flexible, fault-tolerant, dynamic solutions we can use and extend and have applications with annotation, commenting, sharing and highlighting."
