description: "Firefox OS is marketed as an OS for mobile phones. Cool. But what if we do one step back and omit the UI layer. Then a Firefox OS phone is a handset that's cheaper (25$) than a bare-bone Raspberry Pi, that includes a ton of sensors, GPS, network connectivity, a battery and a screen. And on top of that it's running the Gecko render engine that has APIs to access all that goodness. It's time to take some phones apart, start hacking and roll our own OS on top of Gecko. Internet of things FTW!\n\nWhat about a Firefox OS based doorbell system over bluetooth? A jacket tracker with GPS in case you go out and your jacket gets jacked? A small device that tracks how much you drink during a party? Home surveillance using a network of phones and a bluetooth speaker for an alarm? In this session we'll see some crazy hacks, and you'll should be all set to start hacking yourself!"
