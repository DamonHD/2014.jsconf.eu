description: "I'll explain how React is moving towards a minimal API surface area. Instead of providing many framework features, React is trying to utilize patterns, paradigms and JavaScript language features to accomplish the same tasks that other frameworks have dedicated APIs for.\n\nWe start out with higher order runtime features and then backport them to use ES6 language features and syntax. How does the JSX syntax extension fits into this model? I will also touch on the syntax proposals we and other framework authors are making to ES7 and future versions of JavaScript."
