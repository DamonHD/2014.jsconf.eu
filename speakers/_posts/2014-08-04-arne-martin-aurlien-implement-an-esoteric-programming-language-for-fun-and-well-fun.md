description: "Inside most of us there’s a befunge programmer who wants to come out. When doing day-to-day “serious” programming it is usually a good idea to keep them as firmly locked up as possible. Let’s ignore that instinct for a little while.\n\nIn this talk I’ll try to convince you why you should try writing a completely impractical interpreter of your own. I’ll also use terms like “lexer”, “tokenizer” and “parser” at their widest possible definitions."
