description: "First I was afraid, I was petrified  \nKept thinking I could never live without realtime interaction client-side.  \nBut then I spent so many nights thinking how XML did me wrong.  \nAnd I grew strong, and JSON helped me get along  \nAnd so you’re back with no name-space  \nI just walked in to find no silos here ‘cause its all de-cen-tral-ized  \nI shouldn’t used that custom format  \nXMPP and JSON is the key  \nIf I’d known for just one second interoperability wouldn’t bother me"
