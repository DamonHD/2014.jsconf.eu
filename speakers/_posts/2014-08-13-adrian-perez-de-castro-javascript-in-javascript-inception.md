description: "Modern JavaScript engines are able to generate very good machine code. Wouldn't it be a waste to write in C   those parts of the language that can be expressed in JavaScript itself? I will talk about how this is works in different virtual machines, and how this makes it a breeze to modify V8 in particular."
