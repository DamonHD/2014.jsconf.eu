description: "Africa is rising. The population is booming and data visualization is handy in analyzing the opportunities in the continent. Most people access internet via mobile phones so web and mobile solutions that work across different platforms and form-factor devices are more effective. Since the internet is not always reliable we need to think about applications that can work seamlessly with or without internet access."
