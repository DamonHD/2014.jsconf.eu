description: "Web technologies have become the default way to develop data visualizations&#58; they are easy to use, convenient to debug and work across all kinds of devices. And thanks to ever-faster smartphones even they have become a valid platform for web-based visualizations - but creating something decent for them requires a whole new set of skills.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a quick run-through of all the relevant aspects of mobile web-based datavis: \n* What graphics technology (Canvas, SVG, WebGL) to choose?\n* How to include all the neat HTML5-supported sensors to do cool stuff (GPS, device orientation)?\n* What amazing things can be done with multi-touch input?\n* What changes for information and chart design?\n* How to best debug mobile visualizations?\n"
