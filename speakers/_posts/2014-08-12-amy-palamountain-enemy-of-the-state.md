description: "I’m not going to lie - building front end JavaScript applications can be hard. Why? Because state, that's why.\n\nWhen writing code for the client, we are almost entirely interested in how to best structure a would be mess of events and state. As our code base grows and the number of possible states increases, if we aren't careful we can end up in the fetal position, alone and questioning our life choices.\n\nIn this talk we will take a look at some of the patterns we see being commonly applied in client app's to see if the give us ways of handling state and state transition in a scaleable, maintainable fashion. Then we will take a look at some tactics you can use to help you better embrace both state and events, without sacrificing clarity in your architecture."
