description: "D3. NVD3. C3. Highcharts. And now, from Palantir, Plottable. There are seemingly innumerable Javascript charting libraries, all producing similar charts and often built on the same technologies. Why are there so many options? And why does it seem like more are coming out every day?
We will explore the landscape of charting libraries, and explain why Palantir decided to write Plottable.js. We hope to figure out why there are so many of these things, and chart a course towards the One Library – to Rule Them All."
