description: "Mainstream operating systems are bound by abstractions and design decisions largely made decades ago. Modern event-driven software doesn't have a choice but to use less-efficient kernel interfaces. Internet growth brings new challenges for server software and kernel developers. These days we need to handle millions connections and packets per second. This talk tries to answer the questions: how can we optimize JavaScript server software stack to prepare it for such a high loads? And how does JavaScript kernel look like? I'll also show Runtime.JS system that tries to rethink kernel design to improve security, reliability and performance of the system."
