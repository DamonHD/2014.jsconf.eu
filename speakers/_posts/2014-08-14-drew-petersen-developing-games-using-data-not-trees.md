description: "You're finishing up the final bugs for your guaranteed AppStore hit, Asteroids: Totally Different This Time. Just before release, your crazy game designer partner has an epiphany: \"What if... What if _you_ were the asteroids, instead of the ship!? It will subvert the player's every expectation since the dawn of gaming!\"\n\nAnother programmer might despair: the glorious, deep and wide inheritance tree, ruined! The entire code architecture was founded on the player controlling just the ship!\n\nBut instead of despair, you remember that you focused more on the data and the systems that operate on that data, and are able to turn around the new version overnight.\n\nIs this a dream? It might be. Let's find out during this talk.\n"
