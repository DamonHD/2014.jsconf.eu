description: "I am writing in English and you understand me perfectly well. We share a grammar and, thanks to the internet, an ever-growing vocabulary.\n\nI am writing a new JavaScript program and the computer does not understand the words `lodash`, `jquery` or `angular`. I have to `npm install` and `require` these words, and while we've grown used to package managers and module systems I began to wonder: Can we do better?\n\nWhat happens when words like `lodash` and `fibonacci` had meaning without a single `require`, `git clone` or `npm install`? In turn, what if every program you write instantly has a word for it that everyone can use?"
