description: "Everyone knows that Web Components are the future, right? Or maybe you think that a well-written Angular directive has everything you need. Or, perhaps, you think that there's no such thing as a well-written Angular directive and so you'll stick with your Ember components thank-you-very-much. Then again, once your brain is thinking in React, why would you use anything else?\n\nThis talk is about the reality of component-based web development, told through the frivolous pursuit of a more awesome IMG tag for animated GIFs. It's a not-so-serious window into a terribly important debate about better encapsulation, reuse, and happiness in our front-end lives.\n\nWe'll talk about:\n\n- The surprisingly complicated logic involved breaking apart and manipulating GIFs\n- Our ideal Component and how it beautifully hides this complexity\n- The different goals, abstractions and constraints of Polymer, Angular, Ember and React\n- The challenges involved in trying to write a component compatible with all of them\n- What the future of developing reusable components might look like\n\nGIFs have been a part of the Web since the very beginning, and epitomise the beauty of a simple interface for a powerful, flexible component. What better test for the imminent future of the web than to see how it tackles its past?"
