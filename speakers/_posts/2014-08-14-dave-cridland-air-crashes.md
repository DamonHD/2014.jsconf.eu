description: "It's quite likely that at the end of this talk, everyone's going to be too terrified to fly home. This talk contains phrases like \"In two minutes and thirty-one seconds, everyone on this plane is going to die.\". In the course of this talk, the horrific deaths of hundreds of people will be discussed, and we'll look at what killed them in detail.\n\nOn the plus side, air crashes are the most well-investigated complex systems failures, and the lessons learned from these can be reapplied to coping with failure when it happens in the complex systems we build.\n\nAlso, they're a lot more interesting than website outages."
