Guten morgen.

I am here with good news, because we will all be game programmers very soon.

I'm sure a lot of you -- like myself -- kind of got into programming in the first place because you wanted to build the next Mario. In the decade since then it turns out I build a lot more banking apps than Mario, but I'm excited that JavaScript is heading in a direction where we're all going to be able to integrate a couple of things from video games into all of our apps very soon.

Not only do I think these techniques that we can get from game development patterns are useful, I actually think they're inevitable. No matter what you do, you're going to end up integrating at least a few of these things in the next couple of years.

This might make a little more sense if I explain my double life. During the day, I'm "the Node Guy" at Heroku. Whenever any of you file a Node ticket at Heroku, it goes to me. And whenever the build pack doesn't work, I get yelled at. And whenever people are confused about the Dev Center documentation, that's also my fault. So I'm sorry.

This is my serious work. This is the work that I do that people's livelihoods depend on. So it's the scary, slow development work that I do nine-to-five. But it's also really interesting, because it's the first role that I've had where there are literally thousands of production apps that people are earning a living with that I can look at and I can compare. Like how people are following different patterns and how some companies are successful while some aren't.

There's actually a really interesting talk later today about how Toyota Europe is running right now on Heroku. That's by Ray McDermott: you should check it out.

I've gotten a unique insight into how people are building JavaScript apps these days, because I see so many of them every day.

And that's my day job.

At night, I work in a less-serious way. I work on something I like to call "Playful JS". It's JS that doesn't really have a purpose or a point. It's JS techniques that aren't going to help you pass questions when you're interviewing for a job. It's nothing people teach at a university.

But it's stuff I've been interested since I was a kid: games, graphics, audio... I play with stuff like procedural generation. I play with stuff like old-school 3D rendering techniques.

And very occasionally, some crazy company will pay me to build a game in HTML5.

This is becoming a bigger and bigger thing. A couple years ago this would never have happened. Nobody would ever reach and say "Hey, can you build me a game in JavaScript?"

I'm really excited about this and I think this is going to keep on accelerating.

I wanted to highlight that because this is the basis for the talk, and I'm not an expert. I just play with things at night. I am an expert at Node and running production Node apps, but this is my hobby. I'm not a game developer by trade, but I love this stuff and I think more of us are going to become game developers by trade over the next few years. And even if not, it's fun to learn and it's something I think everybody should try at least once.
