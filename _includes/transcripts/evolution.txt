Thank you so much. So, as has been said, my name is Raquel VÃ©lez. I am @Rockbot on all of the things.

I am a senior software developer at npm, Inc. You may have heard of npm, you use it to install all of your wonderful JavaScript things.

I am honored to be able to work there. If I can answer any questions or give you stickers, please let me know. I have answers... and stickers.

So, let's get started.

On a scale of "fist" to "high-five", where would you rate yourself as a developer?

Where a fist is, "I'm just figuring out this whole JavaScript thing. I think I know what a variable is and I'm learning about loops, etc."

To "I have taught Brandon Eich everything he knows."

And you can totally do the Fitbit thing if you want. You can be like, "I'm a three-and-a-half" or whatever. Cool. All right.

You can play along too! Feel free to play along. Cool.

I'm seeing kind of like beginning to middle... That's awesome. Great.

What I'd like to talk about is how we go from here (fist) to here (high-five).

Because I think a lot of us who are here (fist with wiggling thumb), don't know what this path looks like (opens to high-five).

And I think those of us who are here (high-five) forgot what it was like to be here (fist).

So, let's go through that whole process.

It's intense. I am going to use my personal story. This is not going to match everybody's, but I think a lot of the elements are going to be the same.

It all starts out the same for all of us. For whatever reason we say, "I'm going to start learning JavaScript."

Or insert technology of your choice, but I'm going to start with JavaScript.

Whether it's for a business reason or for personal reasons, we say "Okay. This JavaScript thing? I'm going to do it. Let's do this. Yes! Totally!"

For me, I used to be a roboticist. I used to build robots.

And I said to myself, "This is kind of boring, because the robots... they don't really have fun with me. We don't get to party. We don't get to talk about boys. We don't... They're just kind of robots."

And so I decided I needed a little more people in my life.

I was living in Charlotte, North Carolina at the time and I said "Where is a cool place to work? I think the Internet is kinda cool. Let's do that."

I mean, I was a roboticist. The Internet can't be that hard.

I talked to the CEO of the coolest company in town. I said, "I'd really  like to work at your company. What do I need to do to work here?"

He said, "Learn Node."

Okay. Cool. I went home and said, "I am going to learn Node. Let's do this. I'm going to build an application. That's how I learn."

And I got nowhere.

This happens to all of us. We have no idea what we are doing, because we don't know the words that we need.

I knew enough to say, "Node is a project, a thing. Go to the website: nodejs.org."

I downloaded Node. I knew enough about the command-line to say, there's no "application", so I don't double-click.

I go to the command-line and type n-o-d-e enter.

What happens at that point?

You get this caret-y thing. Looks like this: >

You see it also in the JavaScript console, when you go in a browser.

And you're looking at it, and it doesn't say anything.

You're like "Okay..."

So, go! g-o enter.

And what does it say? It says "undefined".

You're like, "Okay. This doesn't work for me at all. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."

I don't have the words. I don't have the vocabulary to use to say "How do I make this thing work?"

So, what do you do next? You go online. Go to Google. Stack Overflow. Blog posts. Whatever. And you start looking for help.

PRO TIP: "caret-y thing in Node" does not produce any useful results. There's just nothing in there.

Again... no vocabulary. No way for me to say, "I have no idea what I'm doing. I need help."

And then on top of that, this was at the beginning of 2012, when Node was super-new. It had been around for a couple of years, but it was still really brand-new.

To the point where any tutorials I found... if it was more than 6 months old, it was completely out-of-date. This isn't even useful to me.

So, whatever. I still try. I find some things.

I start playing around and I say "This is cool, but... I... Caret-y thing? Help?"

So at that point I realized I needed more people in my life. I needed to start asking questions.

So I went to a local meetup. That's a great way to start meeting people. Local developers in your community, and you can actually talk to them.

You can say, "So look, here is my terminal. n-o-d-e enter. Caret-y thing." (shrug)

And they go, "Oh, that's the REPL! Yes, that's the read-eval-print-loop. That's how we do all of our on-demand type stuff. What you really want is, you want a separate file. And then you can run node file."

And then it runs, and magic, and you're like "Oh my god, why did nobody tell me this? I didn't understand anything."

But that's okay. Because you go, and you talk to these people. And they have been there enough that they can read your mind a little bit.

And you're like "Caret-y thing!" and they're like, "Yes, REPL. That's the word." And you're like, "Cool!"

At the same time I was trying to build this app. And I was like, "I have this app. I want it to store data. And I know I need a database, but I've only used MySQL before." Because that's what I used when I was hacking on my Wordpress blog. "Is that what I want to use?"

Whatever you want to say about databases... blah, blah, blah. At the time, what I needed was MongoDB. It was the perfect solution.

Again, talking to people in person. Being able to use words that didn't make sense to Google, but made sense to people, made a huge difference.

Empowered with all this incredible knowledge, I went back to my app.

OK, I'm building this app. I've got Mongoose, and I've got Express. And how do I integrate these things? I don't know. But now I have keywords that I can ask Google.

You type: Mongo Node. There is this wonderful module called Mongoose. They have a website, and they have code samples. You're like "Yes! Perfect! Code samples!" Copy, paste.

I expect magic to happen. And no magic happens. And, you're like, "Why isn't this working? I don't know."

You don't have the concepts fully integrated into understanding how this is all supposed to come together.

So you go back! And maybe your local meetup only meets once a month, so you need to expand your group of people to ask questions.

What did I do? I went on to IRC. If you don't know what IRC is, it's this amazing technology that's been around apparently forever, but I didn't hear about it until 2012.

And it was on IRC that I found the Mongoose.js channel. And I was like "Hi! I'm using your thing. I think it's the right thing for me, but it's not working in my stuff."

They're like, send us your code.

And I did what every single new person does: I copied and pasted all of my code into IRC. It was like, 25 lines of stuff.

Someone said, "Oh, god, please don't do that again."

And then I learned about a thing called Pastebin. That was super-useful. Then of course, gists, etc.

But I did the thing that everybody does, and I got very politely yelled at. "Don't do that again." "Okay."

But still, being able to share my code with someone else from a larger community. People who were from all over the world, not just my local community!

Because when you're hacking at 2 am, sometimes your friends are not awake, but somebody in Germany might be! And that's awesome because they can give you this feedback, and they share more appropriate vocabulary with you, and then you understand the concepts: you understand how things link together. And it's really awesome!

You take all this knowledge. And you're still going to mess up.

If you're not messing-up, you're not doing engineering. Just FYI. This is how it works.

You do good, you mess up, you succeed. It's just this cycle and you just kind of keep moving forward.

But! There is this turning point. These concepts are coming together enough, and you have grown your community enough to the point where you're like "OK, whenever I have a problem, I might not know what it is, and I might not know how to fix it, but I at least know what to ask, where to ask, and who to ask."

Right? Go on IRC, go to your friends, go to your meetup. Whatever. Know exactly the magical keywords to get the thing out of Google or Stack Overflow. Fantastic.

So now you can keep moving forward. And you're like, "Yes! I got this!"

You find this point at which you are like, "Wow, this is actually really cool! This is so fun! I love this!"

But I'm doing this on the side. I have another job, and it is sucking all the life out of me because I really just want to play with Node all the time.

"Maybe I can get a job in Node! Yes! That's totally a perfect idea."

At some point you get to where you know enough information that you can be a junior developer.

Junior developers are useful. They're useful because you can tell them exactly what to do and you don't have to pay them very much money and you can still move forward with your product.

So you bring a junior developer on-board. Yeah, you have to train them a little bit, but you get to train them doing exactly what you want them to do.

So from a junior developer perspective, you're like "Oh my goodness! Now I have this opportunity to get paid while I learn. Awesome."

For me, I got a job as intern. I wasn't even a junior developer yet: I just got enough to be an intern.

I was getting paid 500 dollars a week, which is not very much at all. Especially for someone who is coming from robotics, it was kind of a blow to the ego, but I was like, "You know what? It's worth it. This is gonna be OK. I'm gonna to make it work."

Fantastic. You start working, and you start learning. And then you get to this point where you are like, "This is super fun, but I'm not exactly learning all the things that I want to learn. I'm learning the things that my employer's telling me to learn. And that's fine, because at least for me, I was working at a consulting company, so I got to see a little php, I got to see a little bit of Node, I got to see a little bit of front-end stuff. I was convinced I was going to be a back-end developer because I did robotics.

Then I was like, "Hey, CSS -- as annoying it can be -- is actually really cool. You get to see stuff. And you get to move things. Floats, and divs, and wow!"

And so at that point I kind of transitioned to be more of a front-end person, but still lovin' the Node.

I like to think at it as a buffet of learning. You go in and you just get a little bit each of these little things.

But I still felt like I was missing something.

"Yes, this is our stack at this company, but I know that there's more. I keep hearing these rumours of these single page applications and all this other stuff. Where do you go to learn that?"

Where do you go? You come to one of these. This is where you find out about all those things that you knew you were missing out on, but you didn't know what it was.

How many of you've learned something new that you didn't realize even existed since being here?

Yeah! Exactly.

So, it's fantastic. You get what you are missing.

It is like drinking from a firehose. It's like trying to get a drink of water and whoosh! Right in your face. My goodness, gracious!

But it is totally worth it, because then you get super-excited about all this stuff.

My first conference was NodeConf SummerCamp 2012. I went to this conference hoping to learn more about the event loop. Apparently there's going to be a talk about the event loop later: I'm totally going to that.

But at this conference I didn't learn about the event loop. I learned about "node-core" and "domains" and "error handling" and I was like "Whoa, I just want to learn about the event loop, please. I'm new to this."

But there was another really important aspect of going to a conference.

I learned about people. I met people. Met all of these incredible people that have completely changed my life. Every conference I go to, I meet new people and it's incredible. I become really good friends with these people.

As a side note, if there's nothing else you get out of this entire conference. Nothing. At all. Because let's be real: you can watch these videos at home later...

Walk away with at least 5 twitter handles. 5 Twitter handles of people that you are going to hang out with and talk to on Twitter. If you don't like Twitter, use Facebook or email. I don't care. Make sure you get to know somebody else. Because these people, that are sitting in this room with you? They are going to help you get your next job. They're going to help you when you have a bad day and they'll send you funny cat gifs.

Like, super awesome. These people are really going to change your life. Right here. The ones that are sitting right next to you. And those of you following along at home, come to a conference and let this totally tranform you.

OK. Coming back.

You are talking to these people. You are at the conference zozer there is so much cool technology. I want to play with it.

When do you do it? With all the technology?

You start working on it. On your own.

And yes, it stings. You don't always get to take all the cool technology back to work with you.

There is a good opportunity. If you can hack things on your own.

You expose yourself to a whole other stuff. You get to use all the people you met. And you can ask them, hey, can you take a look at my code?

Here is the thing about open source. It is not about contributing to Jquery. It is taking your source and you open it up. Sharing it on Github.

It doesn't need to be magical. It is some code. Show it to somebody.

Let's someone else say, how did you do that. Inspiration for that.

How did you figure that out?

Getting feedback on your code from somebody else is superuseful.

For me, I was at this conference.

Talking to somebody.

They said to me, hey, use your robotics. We don't have a matrix module.

You know, that's true. There isn't a matrix module.

I used to do robotics.

So, I went aheaid and started hacking on stuff.

You start hacking on things.

You are still going to keep messing up. And failing.

And you succeed. And moments where you are likse this. Run around the office or bedroom, wherever.

It is so exciting you are getting it.

The point is that you are playing with these things.

You get to know the concepts.

And it just starts to feel really good. You are building confidence in yourself.

Actually, I am not new anymore. This is awesome.

You didn't teach Brandon everything he knows. But you feel good about it.

These concepts are really well.

You start to experiment. What happens when people get too confident? They get experimental. I wonder what happens if I do this thing.

It is kinda scary. It is not always going to work.

Once in a while it will.

Also at NodeConf I met Chris Williums.

You may have heard of him.

He is also into robots.

And I remember being at the conference. Yes, you know, what's cool I guess. Whatever.

And then he was like, you used to do robotics fulltime? What are you doing? Why are you in the webthing?

I do Nodepads. I want it to be a real thing.

Okay. That sounds crazy. Maybe afterwards I'm building this matrix module. It is an opportunity to segway into that. That's kind of cool.

These concepts are so solid. And I have all this extra background information. From what I used to do. Things that excite me in general.

And you keep experimenting and playing around. Eventually something starts to stick. Real well.

And for me, this was my vector module. It is actually really cool how basically it is a robotics focus matrix module. For robots. I started building really cool robots with it.

As you are building these things. Hey, people are starting to notice this stuff. Use your stuff.

Whatever it is you are building. At some point it is going to be successful enough people are going to notice.

You are sharing your code, putting it in open source.

People are going to notice.

I never forget the day I got a tweet from Rick Waldrin. I never met by that time.

If you don't know him, he is on Tc39. He wrote Johnny 5.

This is a guy that I totally bowed down on. You know JavaScript. I don't know JavaScript. You are saying my code is really awesome?

This is wild. How did that happen? How did I get here?

Yu completely forget all of the hard work you went through trying to get there.

From that point, you start to realise that as you are writing about your stuff.

You write blogposts, you lead workshops.

This stuff you didn't think of was possible, you are standing up and sharing your knowledge.

And people are starting to think like you are an expert. They are starting you for help.

You are waiting for. These questions. Help me. Here is all of my code.

Hold on.

People start to notice your expertise. That's really exciting. I started to do Nodebuds. We had a workshop at JSconf. International Nodebuds day twice. All these incredible events. More stuff is coming.

I want to hit home. As you start to build expertise, as people start to notice all of the things you are contributing. Other people of your little niche are starting to notice too.

Because as you become more of an expert, to know what you are doing. Other people are going to want to start bringing you on board.

I stopped interviewing at this point. I don't really send my resume out anymore.

I get other people calling me.

I don't want to sound, look at me, I'm awesome.

Other people are noticing that you are really quite good at what you are doing. Believe it or not.

And they start calling you up and say, hey, maybe Isaac Schoeder. The leader of the Node project. Hi, I really like the things you are doing.

I'm starting this new company, Npm Inc. Do you want to come on board?

You have this moment. Like, I'm a total new...

No, you are not. You are not a nube anymore. You have gone from here and you are making your way up. Very slowly.

But you are there.

You are sharing your stuff everywhere.

Everybody is asking for help. How is it so much harder of an idea to say, please come on board I want to pay you to work for me and nobody else.

That's an amazing opportunity.

There gets to be this point at which you realise, despite every syndrome that sits in your head, you have no right to be here.

You say that you have to be up here. Because if you don't share, who will?

And, you realise that you have received so much from this community. So very very much.

They put up with your ridiculous IRC logs and your silly questions like charity thing?

You realise you are not alone. You have to give back. Somebody needs to hear your story.

So, I want you to know, no matter where you are on this scale, seriously. Anywhere you are.

At some point you are like, I know everything there is to know. Someone is going to throw a brand new framework at you.

I want you to remember this major thing.

We are in this together.

We are all in this together.

And wherever you are, we are with you. I'm with you. We are in this together. Sorry, you're stuck.

It is really important to remember that JavaScript is so much more than syntax. Not about semicolons or tabs, spaces.

Any of that.

It is all of us.

Thank you very much.

(applause)
