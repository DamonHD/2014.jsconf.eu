We're happy to announce that [CSSConf EU](http://2014.cssconf.eu) is again inviting the JSConf EU attendees to their party on Friday night!

This will be your first opportunity to connect to fellow JSConf attendees and join into the excitement coming out of CSSConf. You do not want to miss this.

Also, this year, we'll do a ***pre-checkin*** for JSConf at the party entrance. You'll get your badge early and avoid standing in line Saturday morning, so you have more time to enjoy our excellent breakfast.
