<img src="/img/joe-mccann-wants-techno.jpg" align="left" alt="Joe McCann wants techno." style="width:200px;padding:10px"> [Google](http://www.google.com/about/careers/teams/engineering/index.html) and [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.com/) are inviting us again to our main party. (Pssst: As every year we're inviting the entire Berlin tech community as well. We're [selling low price tickets over on ti.to](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2014?release_id=08znzuddg0s))

This year we'll try something new! Since we're a conference and you all want to learn something the JSConf party will start with an actual serious talk. At 9pm, after you had a nice dinner at the venue, we'll convene back into one of our tracks and Tim Pietrusky will present his talk ["Nerd Disco"](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/tim-pietrusky-nerd-disco.html). Sorry, no laptops allowed for this :) [1]

The end of the talk will transition smoothly into our first DJ set and then we're super excited to announce that [ricoloop](http://www.ricoloop.com/) will join us for an incredible beat-box improv loop extravaganza.

We'll float through the night with 3 awesome DJ sets. The party together with dinner and all drinks is included in your JSConf ticket and if you don't have one, we'd still love it if you'd join us for the for the party on Saturday night, so you get a chance to meet all the awesome people who made it to Berlin â€“ and you, the Berlin developer community, get to meet them. Party-only tickets are [20 Euros](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2014?release_id=08znzuddg0s) with entry to the [venue](/location/) at 9pm.

[1] You can store laptops and other items at our wardrobe, so no need to bring anything back to your home or hotel after the regular conference ends.

[1.1] Just making sure everybody knows: There will be a full dinner after conference day one and everyone will be fed and there will be drinks and then also the party is in the same place, so no need to make your own dinner plans or head back to your accommodation.
