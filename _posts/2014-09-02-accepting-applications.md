We have now opened our application for our Diversity Attendee Tickets. **If you would like to apply**, fill out our [three question application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DW0Fudmcnw5Swr-CX1Kipm7qhsIrQieIxZLWt6SKREU/viewform). These are free tickets to JSConf EU, plus up to €500 for travel and hotel, supported by generous community members.

As previously announced, this year we are offering five **Super Golden Diversity Supporter** tickets for sale. We talked about the motivation for this inititive in [a post a couple weeks ago](http://2014.jsconf.eu/news/2014/08/15/diversity-tickets.html).

So far, we have sold two such tickets. Huge thank yous to:

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), our hometown friends behind everyone’s favourite continuous intergration service
- [Mike West](https://twitter.com/mikewest), who bought a stand-alone Diversity Support-Only Ticket. Thank you, Mike!

We will notify recipients of the tickets as soon as possible, and others will remain on a waiting list in case we sell the three remaining Diversity Supporter tickets.

We believe that a more diverse crowd makes for a better event. If you agree, we invite you to become supporter. We still have three [Super Golden Diversity Supporter](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2014?release_id=7fszx8vpdxs) tickets left. You get:

- 1 JSConf EU ticket for yourself to keep.
- 1 JSConf EU ticket for someone in the community who couldn’t afford to come otherwise

(You will pay for both tickets plus a 500€ travel stipend for the other person.)
